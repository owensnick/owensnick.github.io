We study how sequence changes in regulatory regions of the genome and in transcriptional regulators leads to disease. Through this we hope to gain insight into the sequence code that underlies the regulatory regions. We use a combination genomic laboratory techniques, including single-molecule footprinting and computational approaches.

We focus on studying congential, developmental defects causing glucose regulation disorders of neonatal diabetes and congenital hyperinsulinism. We study the developing and adult pancreas to gain insights. We also study other conditions such as congenital heart disease and common diseases such as type 2 diabetes.

We're based at in the Department of Clinical and Biomedical Sciences, University of Exeter.
