We study how sequence changes in regulatory regions of the genome and in transcriptional regulators leads to disease. Through this we hope to gain insight into the sequence code that underlies the regulatory regions. We use a combination genomic laboratory techniques, including single-molecule footprinting and computational approaches.

We focus on studying glucose regulation disorders from rare, congenital, developmental conditions such as neonatal diabetes and congenital hyperinsulinism to common conditions like type 2 diabetes. We study gene regulatory events in the developing and adult pancreas to gain insights. We also study other congential conditions such as congenital heart disease.


We're based at in the Department of Clinical and Biomedical Sciences, University of Exeter.
