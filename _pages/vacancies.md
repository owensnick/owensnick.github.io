**Transposable elements, KRAB Zinc fingers, and primate specific gene regulation in human pancreas development**

* Computational post-doc (fellow or associate): [Job Advert](https://jobs.exeter.ac.uk/hrpr_webrecruitment/wrd/run/ETREC107GF.open?VACANCY_ID=077726gd8c&WVID=3817591jNg)

Studying primate-specific innovation of gene regulatory networks in pnacreas development using perturbation single-cell transcriptomics and chromatin accesibility datasets.

This position is part of a Wellcome Collaborator award, collaboration with Michael Imbeault, Cambridge and Timo Otonkoski & Diego Balboa, Helsinki, together with Elisa De Franco and Andrew Hattersley at Exeter.

Builds of our discovery that primate specific KRAB zinc finger is necessary for pancreas development [medrxiv, accepted Nature Genetics](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.23.21262262v1).
